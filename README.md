# rubocop-auto-gen-config-missing-exclude-demo

This repository demonstrates a bug with

```console
% rubocop --auto-gen-config
```

It correctly detects that the majority of files adhere to the `snake_case` method naming convention.

```ruby
# good/*.rb
def good
end
```

However, while this file violates the convention

```ruby
# bad/zero.rb
def Bad
end
```

no `Exclude` section is added to `.rubocop_todo.yml`, whereas it is for other cops.

```diff
 # This configuration was generated by
 # `rubocop --auto-gen-config`
 # on 2023-12-27 00:45:53 UTC using RuboCop version 1.59.0.
 # The point is for the user to remove these configuration records
 # one by one as the offenses are removed from the code base.
 # Note that changes in the inspected code, or installation of new
 # versions of RuboCop, may require this file to be generated again.
 
 # Offense count: 1
 # Configuration parameters: AllowedPatterns.

This leaves the repository with offenses, despite having just run `--auto-gen-config`.

```console
% rubocop
Inspecting 7 files
.C.....

Offenses:

bad/zero.rb:2:7: C: Naming/MethodName: Use snake_case for method names.
  def Bad
      ^^^

7 files inspected, 1 offense detected
